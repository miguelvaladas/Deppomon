# Deppomon

Inspired by the legal battle between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, we decided to create a fighting game that allows the player to fight Amber Heard.

Our fighting style was inspired in Pokemon (hence the name "Deppomon") and the player may choose between 3 versions of Johnny Depp.

There is room for improvement in our code, however it was a great first experience since the deadline was very strict and we barely knew our team members and yet we managed to create a game we are proud of.

Our tech stack consisted of <b>Java</b> and the <b>SimpleGraphics Library</b>.

## Considerations
We had a lot of fun creating our little game and some of us are still looking for their first opportunity. If you wanna meet us, send us a message!
